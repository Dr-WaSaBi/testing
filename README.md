# Raptor Testing Repos
The purpose of this repo is to try to come up with a git learning template of how to best setup our 2022 code repository

It can be a bit more work, but when done correctly. Can save you.

## Ideas
### More devs
Creating a system that not only allows, but incurages more then one developer of the code
### Branches
Have a dev, and comp/prod branch.   
All work is done over in dev, but after reviewed and PR'd gets pulled in to Compition
