# Branches in git 🕶️
What are branches and why and how should we be using them.

A Branch is copy of the main or what ever branch it was created from at that point in time. When you a change, new idea, or a fix.  You should create a branch for this change/fix/idea.  The namme should be short, but meaningful. 🤔

Case in point.  On the main branch of this testing repo, I just created a new branch, called Branching.  So far in this branch I've created new .md file that isn't in the main branch (this file your reading here), and I've made a change to the README.md file that the topic of branches is a link to this file.

I commited those changes to the branch, and in a bit will commit the changes I'm writting right now into the branch.  When I'm happy with my changes, and everything looks alright.  I'll create a Pull Request, and pull this branch into the main branch.  But how to do that will be a Pull Request branch 😊
