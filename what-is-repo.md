# What is a git repo or Respository?

In is't most simple form, a repo is a folder/file structor where any and all changes are tracked.  This way if a mistake is made, it can be easly rolled back to a point when it was working.

## Creating a repo - or git init

To start a repo from scratch.  Create a new folder.

```mkdir mytestrepo```

Do a change dir into that folder/directory.

```cd mytestrepo```

At this point, you are in a empty folder/directory.  Now we want to inialize our git repo.  

```git init```
